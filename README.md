## Smoker Prediction Using Machine Learning :
- This project predicts whether a person is a smoker based on various health and lifestyle features<br>using a supervised machine learning approach. 
- The model is trained on a dataset with attributes like BMI, age, blood pressure, and more.

## Project Overview :
- Explore the relationship between health indicators and smoking habits
- Preprocess and visualize health data
- Train and evaluate multiple machine learning classifiers
- Predict smoking status based on user input features

## Dataset :
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gauravduttakiit/smoker-status-prediction  

The dataset used includes features such as:
- age
- gender
- height
- weight
- BMI
- blood_pressure
- cholesterol
- glucose
- physical_activity
- alcohol_consumption
- smoking_status (target)

## Models Used :
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest Classifier
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Decision Tree

## Evaluation Metrics :
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1 Score
- Confusion Matrix
- ROC-AUC Score



## Visualizations :
- Correlation heatmaps
- Countplots and bar graphs
- Pairplots for class distributions
- Confusion matrices for classifier comparisons

## Libraries Used :
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Malplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

## Future Work :
- Hyperparameter tuning (GridSearchCV or RandomizedSearchCV)
- Cross-validation for robust evaluation
- Deployment as a web app using Flask or Streamlit
- Integration with health apps for real-time prediction
